# UNDERTALE SOURCE

This is a dump of Undertale's source code, sprites, sounds, music, objects, and rooms. Game assets were extracted manually. All GML script content was taken from the [@Rovoska/undertale](https://github.com/rovoska/undertale) repository.

Sprites, objects, and rooms are categorized into several folders for ease of access.
